# Arduino-Based-Library-Management-System
Issue and return book In 1 Click. (Project Leader )

This project is divided into 3 system.

1. desktop java swing application
2. android book‘s barcode scanner
3. Arduino hardware 

Features:-

1. Desktop system handles every things that does by a libray system application
→ This system was build in java swing class. It interfaces mysql database to store student details, transaction, book details etc.

2. Our android app helps to scan book‘s barcode (which is unique) to each book and send the book‘s barcode to arduino hardware system through bluetooth.

3. The hardware system consists of bluetooth and RFID reader module, RFID card is taken as student ID card, and It accepts the book‘s barcode data when student ID card is inserted into it.
It sends the data to desktop application through ethernet cable.


4. Librarian verified the transaction in one click whether the books are being issuded or returned.
